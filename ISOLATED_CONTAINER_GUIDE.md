# Isolated Container Development Guide

## Overview

Container is now **fully isolated** with no volume mounts:
- ✅ All code and dependencies built into the image
- ✅ No host filesystem access
- ✅ Maximum security and reproducibility
- ✅ Data exchange only via Git or VS Code

---

## How It Works

### Container Lifecycle

```
1. Build Docker image
   ├─ Copy entire project into image
   ├─ Install all dependencies
   ├─ Build Rust WebAssembly module
   └─ Result: Self-contained image

2. Run container
   ├─ Container has complete project
   ├─ Vite dev server accessible on port 5173
   ├─ No filesystem sync needed
   └─ Container is isolated

3. Data flow
   ├─ Edit code locally on Windows
   ├─ Commit to Git
   ├─ Pull changes in container
   └─ Restart container if major changes
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Option A: VS Code Remote Containers (Recommended)

**Best for: Full IDE experience inside container**

1. Install Extension
   ```
   VS Code → Extensions → Search "Remote - Containers"
   Install: "ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers"
   ```

2. Open Container in VS Code
   ```
   F1 → "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container"
   Select: c:\Users\serge\Repos\ressim
   Click: "Reopen in Container"
   ```

3. VS Code connects to container
   - Terminal runs inside container
   - File explorer shows container filesystem
   - Extensions install inside container
   - Full development experience

4. Build and run
   ```bash
   # Inside container terminal
   npm run dev
   # Access at http://localhost:5173
   ```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Full IDE features
- ✅ Direct file access
- ✅ Native development experience
- ✅ Easy debugging
- ✅ Integrated terminal

---

### Option B: Git-Based Workflow

**Best for: Strict isolation with manual syncing**

1. Edit code locally (Windows)
   ```powershell
   # On Windows host
   cd c:\Users\serge\Repos\ressim
   # Edit files in VS Code
   ```

2. Commit changes
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Feature: Add new functionality"
   git push
   ```

3. Rebuild container image
   ```powershell
   docker-compose build --no-cache ressim-dev
   ```

4. Run updated container
   ```powershell
   docker-compose up -d ressim-dev
   docker logs -f ressim-dev
   # Access at http://localhost:5173
   ```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Complete isolation
- ✅ Clear version control
- ✅ Easy rollback
- ✅ Clean history
- ✅ Team collaboration

---

### Option C: Hybrid Approach

**Best for: Flexibility with some isolation**

1. Use VS Code Remote Containers for development
2. Commit changes to Git regularly
3. Push to remote repository
4. Other developers pull and rebuild

---

## Common Tasks

### Start Container

```powershell
# Start
docker-compose up -d ressim-dev

# Check status
docker ps | grep ressim-dev

# View logs
docker logs -f ressim-dev
```

### Access Container

**Option 1: VS Code Remote Container**
```
F1 → "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container"
```

**Option 2: Docker exec**
```powershell
# Interactive bash shell
docker-compose exec ressim-dev bash

# Run command
docker-compose exec ressim-dev npm run build

# Run tests
docker-compose exec ressim-dev cargo test
```

### Rebuild After Changes

```powershell
# Rebuild image with latest code
docker-compose build --no-cache ressim-dev

# Stop old container
docker-compose down

# Start new container
docker-compose up -d ressim-dev
```

### Stop Container

```powershell
# Stop (container persists)
docker-compose stop

# Stop and remove container
docker-compose down

# Remove image too
docker-compose down --rmi all
```

## Benefits of Isolated Container

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **No Volume Mounts** | Complete isolation, no host pollution |
| **Self-Contained Image** | Works identically everywhere |
| **Git-Based Updates** | Version controlled, traceable changes |
| **No File Conflicts** | Host and container independent |
| **Clean Separation** | Clear development vs. build boundary |
| **Easy Sharing** | Push image to registry, teammates use exact version |
| **Security** | No unnecessary host access |
| **Reproducibility** | Same image for dev, test, production |

---

## Workflow Comparison

### Before (Volume Mounts)
```
Windows Host
├─ Project files
├─ Live sync to container
├─ Potential conflicts
└─ Hard to track changes
```

### After (Isolated Container)
```
Windows Host          Container
├─ Project files      ├─ Copy in Dockerfile
├─ Git commits        ├─ Rebuilt on image build
├─ Clear versioning   ├─ Self-contained
└─ Clean separation   └─ Reproducible
```

## VS Code Remote Container Setup (Detailed)

### Prerequisites
- ✅ Docker Desktop running
- ✅ VS Code installed
- ✅ Remote - Containers extension installed

### Steps

1. **Install Extension**
   ```
   VS Code → Extensions
   Search: "Remote - Containers"
   Click: "Install"
   ```

2. **Create devcontainer.json** (Optional but recommended)
   
   Create file: `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
   
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Ressim Development",
     "dockerComposeFile": "../docker-compose.yml",
     "service": "ressim-dev",
     "workspaceFolder": "/app",
     "customizations": {
       "vscode": {
         "extensions": [
           "rust-lang.rust-analyzer",
           "svelte.svelte-vscode",
           "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
           "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
         ],
         "settings": {
           "[rust]": {
             "editor.defaultFormatter": "rust-lang.rust-analyzer",
             "editor.formatOnSave": true
           },
           "[svelte]": {
             "editor.defaultFormatter": "svelte.svelte-vscode"
           }
         }
       }
     },
     "postCreateCommand": "npm install",
     "remoteUser": "root",
     "forwardPorts": [5173, 5174]
   }
   ```

3. **Open Folder in Container**
   ```
   F1 → "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container"
   Select: c:\Users\serge\Repos\ressim
   ```

4. **VS Code Connects**
   - Shows "Opening Folder in Container..."
   - Connects to ressim-dev container
   - Installs extensions inside container
   - Terminal opens inside container

5. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   # In container terminal
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access Application**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Daily Workflow (VS Code Remote)

### Morning
```powershell
# Windows terminal
docker-compose up -d ressim-dev

# Or just open folder in container
# F1 → "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container"
```

### Development
```
1. Edit files in VS Code (inside container)
2. Save file
3. Vite hot-reloads instantly
4. See changes in browser
5. Repeat
```

### Commit
```bash
# Container terminal
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: Description"
git push
```

### End of Day
```bash
# Container terminal
exit

# Windows terminal
docker-compose down
```

---

## Daily Workflow (Git-Based)

### Setup
```powershell
# Windows terminal
docker-compose build ressim-dev
docker-compose up -d ressim-dev
```

### Development
```powershell
# Windows terminal
# Edit files normally in VS Code

git add .
git commit -m "Feature: Description"
git push
```

### Update Container
```powershell
# When significant changes made
docker-compose build --no-cache ressim-dev
docker-compose up -d ressim-dev
```

### Access if Needed
```powershell
# Quick check
docker-compose exec ressim-dev npm run build

# Or full shell
docker-compose exec ressim-dev bash
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Container not running
```powershell
docker-compose up -d ressim-dev
docker logs ressim-dev
```

### Need to rebuild
```powershell
# For new dependencies or code changes
docker-compose build --no-cache ressim-dev
docker-compose restart ressim-dev
```

### Lost work (if not committed)
```
With isolated container: Changes are lost if container deleted
Solution: Always commit to Git before major operations
```

### VS Code can't connect
```
1. Ensure Docker daemon running
2. Ensure container is running: docker ps
3. Restart VS Code
4. Try again: F1 → "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container"
```

---

## Migration from Volume Mounts

If you had volume mounts before:

### Backup your work
```powershell
# Windows terminal
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before migration"
```

### Stop old setup
```powershell
docker-compose down
docker image rm ressim-dev
```

### Build new isolated image
```powershell
docker-compose build ressim-dev
docker-compose up -d ressim-dev
```

### Verify
```powershell
docker ps
curl http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Architecture

### Old (with volumes)
```
Host Filesystem (Windows)
        ↓
    Mount point
        ↓
Container Filesystem
        ↓
Running processes
```

### New (isolated)
```
Host Filesystem (Windows)
        ↓ (Git)
   Repository
        ↓ (Build)
    Docker Build
        ↓
Docker Image (self-contained)
        ↓ (Run)
   Container (independent)
        ↓
Running processes
```

---

## Performance

### Build Time
- First build: 3-5 minutes (installs everything)
- Rebuild after code change: 30 seconds - 2 minutes (depends on changes)
- Rebuild with --no-cache: 3-5 minutes (starts fresh)

### Runtime Performance
- Vite dev server startup: 5-10 seconds
- Page reload: 1-2 seconds (HMR)
- File sync: N/A (no sync needed)
- Container memory: ~500 MB (idle) - 1 GB (running)

### Development Speed
- Code → Save → Auto-refresh: 1-2 seconds
- Same as before, but with better isolation

---

## Security Benefits

✅ **Complete Isolation**
- Container can't access host filesystem
- Host can't corrupt container
- Clear security boundary

✅ **No Accidental Changes**
- Host and container independent
- No surprise file overwrites
- Clean separation

✅ **Reproducible**
- Same image everywhere
- No "works on my machine" problems
- Easy to audit changes (Git)

✅ **Easy Cleanup**
- Delete container: `docker-compose down`
- Delete image: `docker image rm ressim-dev`
- No leftover files on host

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Your Workflow**
   - VS Code Remote Containers (easiest)
   - Git-based updates (most isolated)
   - Hybrid (flexible)

2. **If using VS Code Remote:**
   - Install extension
