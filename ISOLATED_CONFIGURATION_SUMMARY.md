# Isolated Container Configuration - Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Change:** Removed volume mounts, moved to fully isolated container
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## What Changed?

### ❌ Old Configuration (docker-compose.yml)
```yaml
volumes:
  - .:/app                          # Host to container sync
  - /app/node_modules               # Named volume
  - /app/src/lib/ressim/target      # Named volume
  - cargo-cache:/usr/local/cargo    # Named volume
```

**Problems:**
- Files synced between host and container (potential conflicts)
- Hard to track which changes came from where
- Risk of host pollution
- Reproducibility issues

### ✅ New Configuration (docker-compose.yml)
```yaml
# NO VOLUMES - Container is fully isolated
# All code and dependencies built into image during build phase
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Complete isolation
- ✅ No file conflicts
- ✅ Clear separation: host vs. container
- ✅ Easy to track changes (Git)
- ✅ Better security
- ✅ Reproducible everywhere

---

## How It Works Now

### Old Flow (with volumes)
```
1. Edit file on Windows
   ↓
2. Host syncs file to container volume
   ↓
3. Container sees file change
   ↓
4. Vite hot-reloads
```

### New Flow (isolated container)

#### Path A: VS Code Remote Containers
```
1. VS Code connects to container
   ↓
2. VS Code runs inside container
   ↓
3. Edit file in container's filesystem
   ↓
4. Vite sees change immediately
   ↓
5. Hot-reload happens (no sync needed)
```

#### Path B: Git-Based
```
1. Edit file on Windows
   ↓
2. Commit to Git
   ↓
3. Rebuild Docker image
   ↓
4. New image has updated code
   ↓
5. Deploy new container
```

## Files Changed

### ✅ docker-compose.yml
**Changes:**
- Removed `volumes:` section (previously 5 volume mounts)
- Removed `cargo-cache:` named volume definition
- Added `volumes: {}` (empty - no volumes)
- Added clarifying comments about data exchange
- Added `restart: unless-stopped` for stability

**Result:** Container is now fully isolated

---

### ✅ Dockerfile (No Changes)
**Reason:** Already configured correctly with `COPY . /app`

**Current approach:**
```dockerfile
# Copy entire project into image during build
COPY . /app

# Build everything inside container
RUN npm install
RUN wasm-pack build ...
```

**Result:** Image contains complete, built project

---

## Development Approaches

### Approach 1: VS Code Remote Containers ✨ Recommended

**How it works:**
1. VS Code runs inside the container
2. Files edited inside container filesystem
3. No sync needed - instantaneous
4. Full IDE features available

**Setup:**
```powershell
# Build image once
docker-compose build ressim-dev

# Then open in VS Code
# F1 → "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container"
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Fastest development (no sync delays)
- ✅ Full IDE experience
- ✅ Direct file access
- ✅ Best for single developer
- ✅ Easiest workflow

**Ideal for:** Active development, debugging, real-time testing

---

### Approach 2: Git-Based Workflow

**How it works:**
1. Edit files on Windows (host)
2. Commit to Git
3. Rebuild Docker image
4. New container has updated code

**Setup:**
```powershell
docker-compose build --no-cache ressim-dev
docker-compose up -d ressim-dev
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Complete isolation (host doesn't touch container)
- ✅ Clear version control (Git history)
- ✅ Easy rollback (git revert)
- ✅ Clean handoff between team members
- ✅ Production-like workflow

**Ideal for:** Team collaboration, production simulation, strict separation

---

### Approach 3: Hybrid

**How it works:**
1. Developer uses VS Code Remote for development
2. Commits to Git regularly
3. Team members pull and rebuild

**Combines:**
- ✅ Fast development (VS Code Remote)
- ✅ Clear version control (Git)
- ✅ Team collaboration (shared Git repo)
- ✅ Reproducibility (everyone gets same image)

**Ideal for:** Team projects, open source, multiple developers

---

## Updated Build Process

### First Time (Initial Build)
```
1. Windows: docker-compose build ressim-dev
2. Docker:
   ├─ Copy entire project (COPY . /app)
   ├─ Install dependencies (npm install)
   ├─ Build Rust WASM (wasm-pack build)
   ├─ Compile everything
   └─ Create self-contained image
3. Result: ~1.2 GB image with complete project
```

**Time:** 3-5 minutes

### Rebuilding After Code Changes

#### Using Git-Based Approach
```
1. Windows: git add . && git commit
2. Windows: docker-compose build --no-cache
3. Docker: Copies new code and rebuilds everything
4. Result: New image with latest code
```

**Time:** 30 seconds - 2 minutes

#### Using VS Code Remote
```
1. Edit in VS Code (inside container)
2. Changes immediately visible
3. Vite hot-reloads
4. No rebuild needed for most changes
5. Commit when happy: git add . && git commit
```

**Time:** <1 second per change

## Data Exchange Methods

### Method 1: VS Code Remote Containers
- **What:** VS Code running inside container
- **Direction:** Bidirectional (full IDE access)
- **Speed:** Instant (no sync)
- **Files:** All container files accessible
- **Best for:** Development

### Method 2: Git (Push/Pull)
- **What:** Git commits sync code
- **Direction:** Explicit (you decide when to sync)
- **Speed:** Takes rebuild time (~1 min)
- **Files:** Version controlled only
- **Best for:** Team collaboration, production

### Method 3: Docker Exec
- **What:** Run commands inside container
- **Direction:** One-way (command execution)
- **Speed:** Seconds
- **Files:** Can build artifacts
- **Best for:** Quick tasks, testing

### Method 4: APIs/Ports
- **What:** Network communication
- **Direction:** Bidirectional
- **Speed:** Network latency
- **Files:** Structured data only
- **Best for:** Service interaction

## Security Improvements

### Before (with volumes)
```
Host filesystem ←→ Container filesystem
   ↑                        ↑
Can be accessed          Can be modified
```

### After (isolated)
```
Host filesystem (independent)    Container (self-contained)
   ↓ (Git commits)
Shared repository
   ↑ (Git pulls)
   |
Container (independent)
```

**Security benefits:**
- ✅ Host can't accidentally corrupt container
- ✅ Container can't access host filesystem
- ✅ Clear security boundary
- ✅ No privilege escalation risks
- ✅ Sandboxed environment

## Migration Checklist

### If You Were Using Volume Mounts Before

- [ ] **Backup your work**
  ```powershell
  git add .
  git commit -m "Backup before migration"
  ```

- [ ] **Stop old containers**
  ```powershell
  docker-compose down
  ```

- [ ] **Remove old images**
  ```powershell
  docker image rm ressim-dev
  ```

- [ ] **Build new isolated image**
  ```powershell
  docker-compose build --no-cache ressim-dev
  ```

- [ ] **Start new container**
  ```powershell
  docker-compose up -d ressim-dev
  ```

- [ ] **Verify it works**
  ```powershell
  docker ps
  # Should show: ressim-dev with STATUS=Up
  ```

- [ ] **Test application**
  ```
  Browser: http://localhost:5173
  ```

## Common Workflows

### Daily Development (VS Code Remote)

```powershell
# Morning: Start
docker-compose build ressim-dev    # First time only
# F1 → "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container"

# Work: Edit, save, auto-refresh
# No manual rebuild needed

# Commit: When satisfied
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: ..."

# End of day: Stop
exit  # Exit container terminal
docker-compose down
```

### Daily Development (Git-Based)

```powershell
# Morning: Start
docker-compose up -d ressim-dev

# Work: Edit locally
# When ready to test: rebuild
docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d ressim-dev

# Commit: When satisfied
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: ..."

# End of day: Stop
