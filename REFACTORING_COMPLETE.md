## Unit System Summary

| Quantity | Unit | Range |
|----------|------|-------|
| Pressure | bar | 50-1000 |
| Distance | m | N/A |
| Time | day | 0.01-100 |
| Permeability | mD | 1-1000+ |
| Viscosity | cP | 0.1-100 |
| Compressibility | 1/bar | 1e-6 to 1e-4 |

## Key Implementation Details

### Transmissibility
```
T [m³/day/bar] = 0.001127 × k[mD] × A[m²] / (L[m] × μ[cP])
```

### Well Rate
```
Rate [m³/day] = PI [m³/day/bar] × (p_cell [bar] - BHP [bar])
```

```
[m³/bar/day] = Vp [m³] × c_t [1/bar] / dt [day]
```

## Physics Model Status

### What's Implemented ✓
- Two-phase (oil-water) flow
- IMPES pressure/saturation splitting
