## Pre-Setup Checklist

Before you run the setup, verify:

### System Requirements
- [ ] Windows 11 (or Windows 10 with WSL 2)
- [ ] Docker Desktop installed (4.25+)
- [ ] Docker daemon can run (`docker ps` works)
- [ ] 10 GB free disk space (for image + volumes)
- [ ] 4 GB+ RAM available
- [ ] Git installed (optional but recommended)

### Project Status
- [ ] All source code present
- [ ] `package.json` exists
- [ ] `Cargo.toml` exists
- [ ] `vite.config.js` exists
- [ ] `svelte.config.js` exists
- [ ] Project root is: `c:\Users\serge\Repos\ressim\`

### Docker Files
- [ ] `Dockerfile` exists in project root
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` exists in project root
- [ ] `.dockerignore` exists in project root
- [ ] `docker-setup.ps1` exists in project root

---

## Setup Execution Checklist

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Preparation
- [ ] Open PowerShell as Administrator
- [ ] Navigate to: `cd c:\Users\serge\Repos\ressim`
- [ ] Verify Docker daemon: `docker ps` (should work)
- [ ] Verify project files: `ls src/lib/ressim/src/lib.rs` (should exist)

### Step 2: Clean Artifacts (Optional but Recommended)
```powershell
# Remove old build artifacts
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force src\lib\ressim\target -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force src\lib\ressim\pkg -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```
- [ ] Cleanup complete

### Step 3: First-Time Build (3-5 minutes)
```powershell
# Run setup script
.\docker-setup.ps1
```
- [ ] Script runs without errors
- [ ] Output shows "Build FINISHED"
- [ ] Output shows "Container started"
- [ ] Output shows "Application running at: http://localhost:5173"

### Step 4: Verify Container Running
```powershell
# Check container status
docker ps | grep ressim-dev
```
- [ ] Container shows STATUS: Up
- [ ] PORTS shows: 5173->5173/tcp

### Step 5: Verify Application
```powershell
# Open browser
Start-Process "http://localhost:5173"
```
- [ ] Browser opens
- [ ] Page loads (no errors in console)
- [ ] Simulator interface visible
- [ ] 3D grid visible (if configured)

### Step 6: Test Live Reload
- [ ] Edit any `.svelte` file (e.g., `src/App.svelte`)
- [ ] Make a visible change (e.g., change text)
- [ ] Save the file (Ctrl+S)
- [ ] Wait 1-2 seconds
- [ ] Browser auto-refreshes
- [ ] Change visible on page
- [ ] No manual rebuild needed

### Step 7: Test Container Shell
```powershell
# Open shell in container
docker-compose exec ressim-dev bash
```
- [ ] Shell prompt appears (should show `root@...:/app#`)
- [ ] Type: `ls src/lib/ressim/src/lib.rs` and press Enter
- [ ] File exists and is listed
- [ ] Type: `exit` to close shell

### Step 8: View Logs
```powershell
# View container logs
docker logs -f ressim-dev
```
- [ ] Shows Vite startup messages
- [ ] Shows "Local: http://localhost:5173"
- [ ] Shows "press h to show help"
- [ ] Press Ctrl+C to exit logs

## Verification Checklist

All of the following should be true:

### System Level
- [ ] `docker --version` returns version 24.0 or higher
- [ ] `docker ps` shows ressim-dev container
- [ ] `docker stats ressim-dev` shows CPU/memory usage
- [ ] Port 5173 is bound to docker container

### Container Level
- [ ] Container image: `docker images | grep ressim`
- [ ] Container running: `docker ps | grep ressim-dev`
- [ ] Container logs: `docker logs ressim-dev` shows no errors
- [ ] Container shell: `docker-compose exec ressim-dev bash` works

### Application Level
- [ ] http://localhost:5173 loads
- [ ] Page shows simulator interface
- [ ] Console shows no JavaScript errors
- [ ] DevTools shows network requests successful
- [ ] Browser WebGL works (3D rendering)

### Development Level
- [ ] Can edit `.svelte` files on Windows
- [ ] Changes sync to container immediately
- [ ] Browser auto-reloads on save
- [ ] Can access container shell with bash
- [ ] Can run cargo commands in container
- [ ] Can run npm commands in container

### Git Level (Optional)
- [ ] `git status` shows new Docker files
- [ ] Can run: `git add Dockerfile docker-compose.yml .dockerignore`
- [ ] Can run: `git commit -m "Add Docker support"`

---

## Post-Setup Configuration

### Optional: Configure IDE Integration

**VS Code Docker Extension**
- [ ] Install "Docker" extension by Microsoft
- [ ] Verify it detects ressim container
- [ ] Set container as development environment (optional)

**VS Code Remote Containers**
- [ ] Install "Dev Containers" extension
- [ ] Optional: Edit `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

### Optional: Add to .gitignore

Make sure Docker artifacts are excluded:
- [ ] Check `.gitignore` has `.git/`
- [ ] Check `.gitignore` has `node_modules/`
- [ ] Check `.gitignore` has `target/`
- [ ] Verify: `git status` doesn't show build artifacts

### Optional: Update README

Add Docker setup instructions:
- [ ] Add section: "Docker Setup"
- [ ] Link to: `DOCKER_QUICK_START.md`
- [ ] Add quick commands section

---

## Troubleshooting Verification

If you encounter issues, verify:

### Issue: Can't connect to Docker daemon
- [ ] Docker Desktop is running (check taskbar)
- [ ] Docker daemon is initialized (may take 30 seconds)
- [ ] Run: `docker ps` again
- [ ] If still failing, restart Docker Desktop

### Issue: Port 5173 already in use
- [ ] Stop other containers: `docker-compose down`
- [ ] Stop other services using 5173
- [ ] Verify with: `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5173`
- [ ] Try: `docker-compose up -d --force-recreate`

### Issue: Build fails with errors
- [ ] Check logs: `docker logs -f ressim-dev`
- [ ] Look for specific error message
- [ ] Try rebuild: `docker-compose build --no-cache --force-rm`
- [ ] Check disk space: `docker system df`
- [ ] See DOCKER_SETUP_GUIDE.md Phase 7 for solutions

### Issue: Browser doesn't auto-refresh
- [ ] Check Vite logs: `docker logs -f ressim-dev | grep -i hot`
- [ ] Try manual refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
- [ ] Restart container: `docker-compose restart ressim-dev`
- [ ] Check volume mounts: `docker inspect ressim-dev | grep -A 5 Mounts`

### Issue: Rust compilation fails in container
- [ ] Update dependencies: `docker-compose exec ressim-dev cargo update`
- [ ] Clean build: `docker-compose exec ressim-dev cargo clean`
- [ ] Rebuild Rust: `docker-compose exec ressim-dev cargo build --release`
- [ ] Check logs for specific error

### Issue: Container takes too long to build
- [ ] This is normal for first build (3-5 minutes)
- [ ] Subsequent builds use caches (much faster)
- [ ] Check progress: `docker logs -f ressim-dev` in another terminal
- [ ] Monitor resources: `docker stats`

## Daily Workflow Checklist

Each day you develop, follow this pattern:

### Morning Startup
- [ ] Verify Docker Desktop is running

- [ ] Verify running: `docker ps | grep ressim-dev`
- [ ] Open browser: http://localhost:5173
- [ ] Check logs: `docker logs -f ressim-dev` (in another terminal)

### During Development
- [ ] Edit files in VS Code on Windows
- [ ] Save files (Ctrl+S)
- [ ] Watch browser auto-refresh
- [ ] No manual rebuilds needed
- [ ] Check container logs occasionally for errors

### When Modifying Rust Code
- [ ] Edit `src/lib/ressim/src/lib.rs` on Windows
- [ ] Save file
- [ ] Wait for WASM rebuild (check logs)
- [ ] Browser refreshes
- [ ] Test changes

### Evening Shutdown
- [ ] Stop container: `docker-compose down`
- [ ] Commit changes: `git commit ...` (if ready)
- [ ] Close Docker Desktop (optional, can leave running)
