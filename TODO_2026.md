# TODO 2026

## Completed in this review
- Removed stray code fences from `src/lib/FractionalFlow.svelte` so it compiles as a component.
- Cleaned up unused Rust import warning in `src/lib/ressim/src/lib.rs` (`rand::Rng`).

## Pending / Core feature follow-ups
- Add automated regression tests for the simulator core (no test harness exists yet).
- Benchmark/validate against published two-phase flow cases (see docs TODOs).
- Implement gravity terms in pressure/flux calculations if needed for thick reservoirs.
- Consider 3-phase flow support (gas) and aquifer modeling.
- Add performance profiling for the Rust solver and front-end rendering.
