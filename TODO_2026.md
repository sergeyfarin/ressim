# TODO 2026

## Current Status Summary (2026-02-15)

### Core capabilities now in place
- Browser-based 3D reservoir simulator (Rust + WASM + Svelte/Three.js).
- Worker-based stepping for responsive UI during simulation runs.
- Replay/history controls and scenario presets for reproducible demos.
- Property visualization with adaptive legend mode (`Fixed` vs `Percentile`) and clear unit labels.
- Analytical Buckley-Leverett comparison integrated with frontend rate plotting.
- Benchmark artifact pipeline (`scripts/export-benchmarks.mjs` → `public/benchmark-results.json`) wired into UI and CI.

### Latest checks
- Frontend build: `npm run build` ✅
- Rust core check: `cargo check` ✅
- Benchmark validation (P4 set): completed and documented
- Known non-blocking warnings: DaisyUI `@property` compatibility warning, large JS chunk warning

## Future Plan

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement 3-phase extension (oil/water/gas) with phased API + UI rollout.
- [ ] Add acceptance tests for end-to-end parity between worker snapshots and direct simulator state.
- [ ] Strengthen production readiness of benchmark publishing (CI validation + artifact integrity checks).
- [x] Reduce largest frontend chunks to improve initial load performance.

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add structured scenario export/import (JSON) for repeatable studies.
- [ ] Expand physics regression coverage for gravity + capillary interactions across heterogeneous permeability fields.
- [ ] Add benchmark trend tracking across commits (baseline drift dashboard or report).
- [ ] Improve in-app diagnostics panel for timestep/adaptation and mass-balance indicators.

### Nice-to-Haves
- [ ] Optional aquifer coupling model.
- [ ] Uncertainty/sensitivity batch runner for seeded permeability ensembles.
- [ ] Comparative visualization mode (side-by-side scenarios / delta maps).
- [ ] Optional report export (plots + key metrics snapshot).
